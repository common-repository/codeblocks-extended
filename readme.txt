Codebocks Extended with PrismJS includes syntax highlighting, copy to clipboard, and Visual + Text editor integration.

== Description ==

Codeblocks Extended with PrismJS was born of a personal need for a lightweight code highlighter, with special functionality. 
Many of the other PrismJS based plugins in the repository were either outdated, or were lacking features that I was looking for.

Features:

*   Integrates the latest PrismJS build, with the most common langauges used.
*   Integrates the PrismJS line-numbers plugin, to automatically number lines of code.
*   Integrates the PrismJS line-highlight plugin to allow you to highlight specific lines of code.
*   Integrates ClipboardJS + custom jQuery to add a "Copy to Clipboard" button to each code block.
*   Custom Text Editor button to wrap selected text with the most commmon `<pre>` and `<code>` classes, and replacing special characters with their HTML safe equivalents.
*	Custom Visual Editor / TinyMCE dropdown button, with the most common languages to wrap selected text.
*	Since this works via wrapping `<pre>` and `<code>` tags with classes, you can use all custom class settings that PrismJS offers.
*	No shortcodes to mess with, so you don't have to worry about losing whitespace between editor modes.
*	No settings page needed: Just activate it and go!

For a full list of languages supported and more information on this plugin's use, please check out the FAQ.

Note: This does NOT auto-detect the language. Most plugins that do so brute force the languages or require file extensions, resulting in a much heavier plugin. The decision was made to keep this as light-weight as possible.

Note 2: This is designed to work with the Classic Editor. It does not currently work in Gutenberg blocks.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I highlight lines of code? =

You can specifiy lines to highlight using the data-line attribute of the `<pre>` tag, in the Text Editor.

* Single Line: data-line="7"
* Range: data-line="3-9"
* Combination: data-line="2,4-6,9-12"

= What other cool things can I do? =

* You can link to individual lines of code, using href="#{pre-element-id}.{lines}". Ex: href="#preblockone.5-6".
* If you are comfortable, you can rebuild prism.min.js to include other languages than the ones below, or modify your CSS.
